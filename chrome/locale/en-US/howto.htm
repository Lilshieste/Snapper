        <span class="sectionHeader">How to use Snapper</span><br />
        Using Snapper to capture images from web pages is simple:
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the web page containing the information you want to snapshot.</li>
            <li>
                Enable Snapper by using one of these methods:
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the Snapper icon, on the bottom status panel of the window.</li>
                    <li>Bring up a context-menu on the page, and select "Start Snapping"</li>
                    <li>Bring up a context-menu on the Snapper icon, and select "Start Snapping"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Click and drag on the webpage to select the area to be included in the snapshot.</li>
            <li>After the area selection has been made, a dialog will appear to save the snapshot.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div id="helpNote">
            Note: After successfully taking a snapshot, Snapper automatically resets to allow normal
            navigation on the web page.

        <span class="sectionHeader">Using the Different Snapping Modes</span><br />
        Starting with release 2.0, Snapper allows users to snap their images in multiple ways.  The Snapping Mode may be specified in
        Snapper's Options window, by right-clicking on the Snapper icon and selecting "Options...".
        <ul>
            <li><u>Simple Snapping</u> - This is the default behavior of Snapper.  To snap an image, the user enables Snapper,
            clicks the mouse button, and designates the area to be snapped.  Immediately after the selection is made, Snapper
            copies and/or saves the snapped image, and allows the user to resume normal webpage browsing.</li>
            <li><u>Anchored Snapping</u> - A new mode introduced in version 2.0.  At first, this mode behaves in a similar manner
            to Simple Snapping.  That is, the user enables Snapper, and designates an area on the web page to snap.  After doing
            so, though, Snapper allows the user to move and resize the snapping area, for finer control over the snapped image.
            After adjusting the area to be snapped, the user then double-clicks on the snapping area to complete the snapping.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
		<span class="sectionHeader">Copying Snapped Images to the Clipboard</span><br />
        Copying snapped images to your system's clipboard is just as easy as saving them to a file.
		Navigate to Snapper's options page (right-click on the Snapper icon, and select "Options..."),
		where you still see a collection of radio button options:
		<ul>
            <li><u>Copy image to clipboard</u> - Only copy the snapped image to the clipboard (does not save)</li>
            <li><u>Save image to file</u> - Only save the snapped image to a file (does not copy)</li>
            <li><u>Copy & Save</u> - Copies the snapped image to the clipboard *and* saved it to a file</li>
        </ul>
