            The <span class="contributor">Firefox developers</span> for designing a great architecture on which these extensions can be built.<br />
            All of Snapper's <span class="contributor">faithful users</span> - I hope Snapper proves to be very helpful to you!

            I am a software developer living in Texas (just moved from the the San Francisco Bay Area).  In my spare time, I enjoy writing code
            (hence, Snapper), playing my Xbox 360, and going on the occasional hike with my wife.<br />

            You might think that this extension has some features that closely resemble those
            of a certain software package.  I think you're just imagining things.
